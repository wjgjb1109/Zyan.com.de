Why use Zyan?
=============

Easy to use
-----------
Zyan is very easy to learn and use. It provides clean intuitive API for hosting and accessing remote components.

Compact and secure
------------------
Supports transparent realtime traffic compression and encryption. Doesn't require digital certificates, supports Windows and Linux platforms.

Unobtrusive
-----------
All you need is plain .NET classes and interfaces: no MarshalByRefObjects, no ServiceContract attributes are necessary.

Multiprotocol
-------------
Supports TCP, HTTP and Named pipes. Extensibility model allows plugging any custom transport protocols.

Full duplex TCP
---------------
Supports bidirectional TCP communication through client-side NAT and firewalls.

Supports duck typing
--------------------
Zyan is able to host component that matches an interface, but doesn't implement it.

Supports events
---------------
Distributed events are as easy as button_Click in Windows Forms applications. Distributed Event-Based Components (EBC) are supported out-of-the-box.

LINQ-enabled
------------

Supports LINQ queries to the remote components. Allows passing serialized LINQ expressions over network and generating anonymous classes on demand.

Extensible
----------
Plug in custom transport protocols, session manager, authentication provider, and more. Build loosely coupled client-server systems using Zyan and MEF.

Unit tested
-----------
Zyan code is extensively covered with unit tests and integrational tests. Integrational tests are executed on Windows and Linux using Mono.

Enterprise ready
----------------
Zyan Framework is used in commercial enterprise applications. Check out the «Who uses Zyan Communication Framework» section.
